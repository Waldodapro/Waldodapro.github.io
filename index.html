                                <p>The Turing machine was a brilliant idea that became the foundation of all modern computers.</p>
                                <p>Alan Turing came up with this theoretical device while studying at Princeton University. It was basically a mental model that could run any algorithm, showing what could and couldn't be calculated mechanically.</p>
                                <p>Though Turing created it to tackle a purely mathematical problem, his work ended up being crucial for British military codebreaking during World War II. His ideas helped build the Bombe machines at Bletchley Park that broke German Enigma codes, cutting the war short and saving countless lives.</p>

                            <p>The first general-purpose electronic computer.</p>
                            <div class="details">
                                <p>ENIAC was the first electronic computer you could actually program to solve different problems, built for the U.S. Army during World War II.</p>
                                <p>The Army wanted it to calculate artillery firing tables, but the project ran way over budget. It cost $487,000 (about $7 million today) instead of the planned $61,700. Still, the military got their money's worth as it changed computing forever.</p>
                                <p>Six women became the world's first computer programmers, figuring out how to make ENIAC work not just for artillery calculations but also for hydrogen bomb research, weather forecasting, and studying cosmic rays. This set the pattern of military funding driving computing breakthroughs that continues today.</p>

                            <p>The building block of modern electronics.</p>
                            <div class="details">
                                <p>The transistor was dreamed up at Bell Telephone Labs by three scientists: John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. It could boost electrical signals and switch them on and off – something only bulky vacuum tubes could do before.</p>
                                <p>The military quickly saw how useful tiny transistors could be, funding research and using them first in radar systems and specialized equipment when they were still too expensive for everyday products.</p>
                                <p>This little device turned out to be one of the most important inventions ever, making electronics smaller and using less power. Without transistors, we wouldn't have the chips that run our phones, computers, and pretty much everything else with an on/off switch.</p>

                            <div class="details">
                                <p>UNIVAC I was the first computer made to sell to businesses and government in the United States. It was created by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the same guys who built ENIAC.</p>
                                <p>The first one went to the Census Bureau, but the military snatched them up quickly too. The Air Force, Navy, and Army all bought these machines for their data work, showing how the military kept pouring money into early computing.</p>
                                <p>This giant machine weighed 13 tons and had over 5,000 vacuum tubes. It became famous when it correctly predicted Eisenhower would win the 1952 presidential election after seeing just 5% of votes. That was the moment regular people started to realize computers might be important in everyday life.</p>

                                <p>ARPANET, which grew into today's internet, was built by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency because they wanted a network that could still work even if parts of it were destroyed in a nuclear attack.</p>
                                <p>The military spent about $1 million a year on this project, which first connected four university computers in 1969: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.</p>
                                <p>Despite being created for military purposes, the network took on a life of its own as researchers used it to share information openly with each other. That spirit of openness eventually shaped the internet we use today, showing how technology can outgrow its original purpose.</p>

                                <p>Unix was a clever operating system created at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie after a larger, military-funded project called MULTICS fell apart. They kept the good security features but made everything simpler.</p>
                                <p>Though the military didn't directly pay for Unix at first, they quickly started using it in defense systems because it was secure, could handle multiple users at once, and had a flexible design. The Department of Defense later standardized on Unix versions for many important systems.</p>
                                <p>The way Unix was built – using small tools that could be connected together rather than one massive program – influenced nearly every operating system that came after it, including Linux and macOS. Its impact on how software is designed can't be overstated.</p>

                                <p>Military and intelligence agencies were the big buyers of these massive machines. The first Cray-1 was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for $8.8 million ($42 million today), where they used it to simulate nuclear weapons and crack codes.</p>
                                <p>It could perform 160 million calculations per second, which was mind-blowing at the time. The Cray-1 established America as the leader in high-performance computing, becoming essential for military simulations, weather forecasting, and scientific problems too complex to test in the real world.</p>

                                <p>IBM used off-the-shelf parts and published their technical details, allowing other manufacturers to make compatible machines. This accidentally created the huge market of "IBM PC clones" that would dominate computing for decades.</p>
                                <p>Their fateful decision to let Microsoft provide the operating system instead of making it themselves changed history. It put Microsoft in the driver's seat of the software industry and created the split between hardware and software companies that still shapes computing today.</p>

                                <p>The Macintosh changed how people used computers by introducing the first commercially successful graphical interface with mouse control, making computers accessible to non-technical folks.</p>
                                <p>Apple's famous "1984" Super Bowl ad, directed by Ridley Scott, painted the Mac as a tool for creativity and freedom against the corporate conformity of IBM PCs.</p>
                                <p>Though it was expensive and limited at first, the Mac pioneered design ideas that eventually showed up in all personal computers, including windows, icons, menus, and mouse pointers. It transformed computers from technical tools into creative devices for regular people.</p>

                                <p>Windows 1.0 was Microsoft's first attempt at a graphical interface, created as an answer to Apple's Macintosh. It let IBM PC compatible computers run several programs at once in a more user-friendly environment.</p>
                                <p>People criticized it for being slow and limited compared to the Mac, but it represented Microsoft's critical move from making programming languages to creating operating systems.</p>
                                <p>This humble beginning eventually grew into the world's dominant computer operating system, with later versions of Windows powering over 90% of the world's personal computers by the 1990s, making Microsoft the most influential software company on the planet.</p>

                                <p>The World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, turned the internet from a specialized network used by academics and government into a global information system anyone could access.</p>
                                <p>By creating three key technologies – HTML for structuring content, URLs for addresses, and HTTP for transferring data – Berners-Lee built a platform where anyone could publish information without asking permission from gatekeepers.</p>
                                <p>His decision to give away these technologies for free instead of patenting them allowed explosive growth, creating the largest collection of human knowledge in history and completely changing how we communicate, do business, and share ideas across borders.</p>

                                <p>Linux, an open-source operating system core created by Finnish student Linus Torvalds, combined the power of Unix with a new approach to software development where volunteers worldwide contributed code.</p>
                                <p>Released under a license that kept the source code free and available to everyone, Linux grew from a hobby project into the backbone of the internet, running most web servers, supercomputers, and eventually Android phones.</p>
                                <p>This collaborative approach challenged traditional software development models and proved that complex, high-quality software could be created through voluntary cooperation rather than corporate development, changing how software would be written for years to come.</p>
